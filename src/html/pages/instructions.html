<h2>How to use Calcium in your project</h2>

<h3>Include Calcium.</h3>
<p>Include the production files from the <code><a href="https://github.com/chancestrickland/calcium/tree/gh-pages">gh-pages</a></code> branch. We recommend either downloading the releases or using a submodule.</p>

<h3>Calcium CSS.</h3>
<p>For simple projects, you can just load the compiled CSS files directly in your page.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;calcium/assets/styles/calcium.css&quot; /&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Calcium SASS.</h3>

<p>For more complex projects, you can include the SCSS files at the top of your SCSS file. You will need to define the project path so that images load correctly. See the example SCSS file below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-scss">// Define image path, relative to your project's main SASS file.
$cd-images: "./../vendor/calcium/assets/images";

// Include the Calcium SASS file.
@import "./../vendor/calcium/assets/sass/calcium";

// Your custom styles here.</code></pre>

<h3>JavaScript.</h3>
<p>Calcium aims to have minimal JavaScript, and it is completely optional. The small ammount there is should be as lightweight as possible, without any dependencies. You can include the <code>calcium.min.js</code> file in your project for a few nice little extra features (e.g. code syntax highlighting).</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src=&quot;calcium/assets/js/calcium.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>Fonts.</h3>
<p>Calcium uses IBM Plex Mono for both headings and body fonts. You will need both 200 and 600 weights. These fonts are open source and available to use as web fonts, or you can load them via Typekit or Google Fonts if preferred.</p>

<h3>Updates.</h3>
<p>We aim to maintain full compatability between minor releases however major releases may include breaking changes.</p>
